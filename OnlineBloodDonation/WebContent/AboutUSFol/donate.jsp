                             	  Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis).
                              	  Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
                             	  Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others. 
							  	  There are several types of blood donation, which help meet different medical needs.

										Donated platelets are commonly given to people with leukemia,people receiving chemotherapy and babies with severe infections.

                           			 Plasma helps blood clot and contains proteins and other substances, such as electrolytes, that help the body function normally.
                           			 Plasma is commonly given to people with liver conditions, burns and severe bacterial infections in their blood.
