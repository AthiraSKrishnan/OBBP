							<h2>ONLINE BLOOD BANK PORTAL </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>There are lots of communication gap among patients (accepting blood), donors (who donate blood), blood banks and hospitals in our country. Medical facility is not available equally in every part of the locations. If someone needs blood, first of all he/she searches it within his family members, then nearest hospitals and blood banks. If they cannot manage blood in these ways, it is really hard for them to contact other people to collect blood in a short time. That is the problem we want to solve through our application, Online Blood Bank Portal in which gives information about the donors and availability of the blood. Through this application, any person interested in donating blood can register himself as donor.</p>
							<p>Moreover, if any general consumer wants to make request to have blood online, he/she can also take the help of this system. As soon as any update occurs in the blood database, the changes are reflected in all the interfaces used. So, the system provides a simple and quick interaction among various groups connected with the blood banks. The main objective is to improve the efficiency of data communication within the supply chain to reduce response time for each blood demand request. We also focused on managing blood bank effectively. The results have shown that the proposed system helps enhancing the communication among blood partners within the supply chain network. The recipient can get blood on emergency. Some existing applications of blood donation system are manual which cannot upload and download the latest update and there is no use of web services.</p>
